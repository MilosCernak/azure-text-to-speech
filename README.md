# azure-text-to-speech
Minimal node.js Azure Text-to-speech example

Configure your own azure key and region (replace values `YourSubscriptionKey` and `YourServiceRegion` in `index.js`)<br>
and then use `npm install` and `npm start` to run the example.

After running the example, a new file `output.mp3` will be created in the project directory.
